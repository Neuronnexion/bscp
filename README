Bscp - Secure and efficient copying of block devices
====================================================

Bscp copies a single file or block device over an SSH
connection, transferring only the parts that have changed.

In other words, it handles the edge case where RSync fails.


Usage
=====

bscp SRC HOST:DEST [BLOCKSIZE] [HASH]


Comparison
==========

Bscp is similar to the classic blocksync.py [1], but
provides the following advantages:

* It doesn't have to be installed on server side.

* It uses a stronger hash algorithm (SHA-1 instead of MD5),
  which is also configurable at command line.

* The client-server protocol is designed to communicate
  in bigger chunks, so it is more suitable to network
  connections with bad latency.
