Bscp - Secure and efficient copying of block devices
====================================================

Bscp copies a single file or block device over an SSH
connection, transferring only the parts that have chaged.
In other words, it handles the edge case where RSync fails.

Bscp is similar to the classic blocksync.py [1], but
provides the following advantages:

* It doesn't have to be installed on server side.

* It uses a stronger hash algorithm (SHA-1 instead of MD5),
  which is also configurable at command line.

* The client-server protocol is designed to communicate
  in bigger chunks, so it is more suitable to network
  connections with bad latency.


Usage
=====

    bscp SRC HOST:DEST [BLOCKSIZE] [HASH]
